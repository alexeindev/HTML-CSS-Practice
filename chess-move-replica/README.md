This project is a personal practice build of a chessboard using CSS Grid.
It focuses exclusively on HTML structure and CSS styling, without JavaScript or backend functionality.

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of modern CSS layout techniques, especially:

CSS Grid: for building the 8×8 board and placing pieces precisely.

Flexbox: for simple page framing and centering (optional).

Features

Pure HTML5 and CSS3, no frameworks or libraries.

Chessboard rendered with CSS Grid (8 columns × 8 rows).

Exact replication of a classic bishop endgame study position.

Clean and organized folder structure.

Position Replicated

Based on the well-known study “An Amazing Bishop Endgame” (P. Heuacker, 1930).
Setup (White to move):

White: King c1, Bishop b8, Pawn h5

Black: King h3, Bishop d3, Pawn e4

Project Purpose

This project is part of my personal learning journey to improve frontend development skills.
It does not aim to implement chess logic or interactivity, but to replicate the board and a historical position for layout practice.
