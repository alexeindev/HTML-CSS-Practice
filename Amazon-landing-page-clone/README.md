# Amazon Clone (HTML & CSS)

This project is a **personal practice clone of Amazon's landing page**.  
It focuses exclusively on **HTML structure** and **CSS styling**, without JavaScript or backend functionality.  

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of **modern CSS layout techniques**, especially:
- **Flexbox**: for creating responsive navigation bars and product sections.  
- **CSS Grid**: for building structured layouts and aligning content efficiently.  

---

## Features
- Responsive layout using **Grid** and **Flexbox**.  
- Clean and organized folder structure.  
- Pure **HTML5** and **CSS3**, no frameworks or libraries.

## Project Purpose
This project is part of my **personal learning journey** to improve frontend development skills.  
It does not aim to reproduce Amazon’s functionality, but rather to replicate the **layout and design elements** for practice.
